                “To the people who love you, you are beautiful already. This is
                not because they’re blind to your shortcomings but because they
                so clearly see your soul. Your shortcomings then dim by
                comparison. The people who care about you are willing to let you
                be imperfect and beautiful, too." ― Victoria Moran.

              <p>
                “Life is too short to waste any amount of time on wondering what
                other people think about you. In the first place, if they had
                better things going on in their lives, they wouldn't have the
                time to sit around and talk about you. What's important to me is
                not others' opinions of me, but what's important to me is my
                opinion of myself.” ― C. JoyBell C.

                “You can be the most beautiful person in the world and everybody
                sees light and rainbows when they look at you, but if you
                yourself don't know it, all of that doesn't even matter. Every
                second that you spend on doubting your worth, every moment that
                you use to criticize yourself; is a second of your life wasted,
                is a moment of your life thrown away. It's not like you have
                forever, so don't waste any of your seconds, don't throw even
                one of your moments away.” ― C. JoyBell C.
